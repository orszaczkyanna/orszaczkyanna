### Hi, I'm Anna

I'm a junior developer currently focused on JavaScript and related technologies, but I'm open to working in any language where my knowledge is sufficient or in a role that allows me to improve.</br>
I'm looking for a part-time or flexible remote position where I can gradually develop my skills while contributing to real-world projects.
